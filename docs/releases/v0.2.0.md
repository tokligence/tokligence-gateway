# Tokligence Gateway v0.2.0 (reissued)

Date: 2025-10-31

This reissue finalizes the Anthropic‑native endpoint (Claude Code) with a single, proven translation path and robust logging. It supersedes the earlier v0.2.0 build.

## Highlights

- Streaming Tool Bridge (Anthropic → OpenAI)
  - Stream handling is now performed by the in‑process translation module. Anthropic SSE (`message_start`, `content_block_*`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`) is emitted consistently and accepted by Claude Code.

- Anthropic Passthrough Toggle (independent)
  - Config: `TOKLIGENCE_ANTHROPIC_PASSTHROUGH_ENABLED` (INI: `anthropic_passthrough_enabled`).
  - Useful for upstream usage accounting or comparison; during development, disable to exercise the translation path.

- Documentation and Tests
  - README includes Go version badge and verified compatibility with Claude Code v2.0.29.
  - Translation module unit tests cover text‑only and non‑stream JSON paths.

## Upgrade Notes

1. Pull the new version and run `go test ./...` — should pass.
2. Tested with Claude Code v2.0.29. Anthropic clients receive proper SSE with `event` and `data` fields.
3. For upstream Anthropic usage accounting, keep `TOKLIGENCE_ANTHROPIC_PASSTHROUGH_ENABLED=true`. Set to `false` to force translation for testing or custom accounting.

## Reissue Summary

- Replace legacy bridge code with a single in‑process translation module under `internal/translation`
- Sidecar‑only Anthropic handler for `/anthropic/v1/messages` (no legacy branches)
- Correct SSE delta mapping and close semantics (fixes Claude Code client parse errors)
- Configurable OpenAI completion `max_tokens` clamp to avoid upstream 400s
- Rotating logs (daily + size), separate CLI/daemon log files, and optional auth disable for development
