● Perfect! I've completed all the tasks you requested:

  Summary of Completed Work

  1. Git Commits ✅

  Committed changes in 4 logical batches:
  - Database schema updates with soft delete support
  - CLI support for hard delete operations
  - Exchange to marketplace renaming
  - Makefile build command fixes

  2. Documentation Created ✅

  docs/schema_design.md

  - Complete database schema documentation for OSS version
  - Covers identity database (users, api_keys tables)
  - Covers ledger database (usage_entries table)
  - Includes soft delete patterns and migration strategies

  tokligence-gateway-enterprise/docs/schema_design_extension.md

  - Enterprise extensions to the base schema
  - Organizational hierarchy (organizations, teams)
  - Advanced features (audit_logs, billing_invoices, quota_limits, model_permissions)
  - Migration path from OSS to Enterprise

  docs/api_key_model_management_proposal.md

  - Based on litellm's design analysis
  - Model access control (allowed/blocked models)
  - Rate limiting per API key
  - Budget management
  - Enhanced metadata
  - Marketplace integration layer for token trading

  docs/comprehensive_billing_and_provider_management.md

  - Multi-provider management (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  - Billing aggregation at org/team/user levels
  - Unified routing with cost optimization
  - Provider health monitoring and load balancing
  - Complete CLI command reference

  3. Key Design Decisions

  1. Soft Delete by Default: All records preserved with deleted_at timestamp
  2. UUID Support: Every record has a UUID for distributed compatibility
  3. Multi-Level Billing: Aggregation at organization, team, and user levels
  4. Provider Abstraction: Support for multiple upstream providers with failover
  5. Marketplace Integration: Dual role support (consume and provide tokens)
  6. Cost Optimization: Intelligent routing based on cost, quality, and latency

  4. Architecture Highlights

  The design supports:
  - OSS Edition: Single user/small team with SQLite
  - Enterprise Edition: Multi-org with PostgreSQL
  - Marketplace Integration: Buy/sell tokens dynamically
  - Provider Management: Multiple upstream APIs with load balancing
  - Comprehensive Billing: Full cost tracking from provider to end-user

  All documentation has been created to guide implementation of these features, providing a clear roadmap for evolving from the current basic system to a full-featured gateway with enterprise capabilities
  and marketplace integration.
